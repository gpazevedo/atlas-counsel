"""Deterministic synthetic procurement corpus generator.

Design contract:
  * Fully seeded — same seed in, byte-identical corpus out.
  * No network, no LLM calls. The "real-ish" content is template-driven so
    the planted hard cases land in known places and the repo is public-safe.
  * Hard cases are explicit and tagged, so eval can prove the retriever and
    grounding logic actually handle them:
      - contradiction:        two vendors with conflicting SLA uptime
      - threshold-precision:  near-duplicate policies differing by one number
      - unanswerable:         a question whose answer is absent by design
      - cross-vendor:         multi-hop question spanning two contracts
