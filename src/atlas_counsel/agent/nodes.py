"""Agent nodes + routing.

Each node is `(state) -> partial state`. Routers are `(state) -> next node
name`. Keeping nodes pure (no hidden I/O beyond the injected retriever/llm)
makes the whole graph deterministic under the offline providers and therefore
unit-testable.

Control flow:

    plan -> retrieve -> validate
    validate --grounded--> synthesize
             --insufficient & gap left--> gap_analyze -> retrieve   (iterative)
             --insufficient & exhausted--> human_gate
    synthesize -> verify
    verify --pass--> finalize -> END
           --unfaithful & attempts left--> synthesize   (retry)
           --unfaithful & exhausted--> human_gate
    human_gate --steer--> synthesize
               --decline--> finalize(refuse) -> END
